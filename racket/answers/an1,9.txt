The first procedure runs recursive process, because the subprocedure (+ (dec a) b) need to be evaluated first before being process by it's parent procedure inc. So the process would look like:
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9

The second procedure runs iterative process, because the process of (dec a) (inc b) keep iterating themselves until they meet the predicate (= a 0). So the process would look like:
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
9
